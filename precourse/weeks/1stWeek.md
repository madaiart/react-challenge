#### Structure of Simple present
The simple present is formed by:

> S + V (base form) + O

**Note** Simple present, third person singular
1. **he, she, it:** in the third person singular the verb **always ends in -s**. For example: He want**s**. She need**s**.
2. Negative and question forms use DOES (the thrid person of the auxiliary 'DO') **+** the infinite of the verb. For Example: He want**s**. **Does** he want? He **does** not want or She **does**n't want.
3. Verbs ending in **-y**: Ther third person changes the **-y** to **-ies**. For exmaple: fly => fli**es**, cry => cri**es**.
   > *Exception*: If there is a vowel before the **-y**. For example: pla**y** => play**s**, pra**y** => pray**s**
4. Add **-es** to verbs ending in: **-ss, -x, -sh, -ch**
5. Others 
   1. be => am, is, are
   2. do => does
